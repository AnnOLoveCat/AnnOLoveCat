                    In addition to learning how to cook food at home, I will design characters, draw cards, and set stories and characters in the Unity card game library of ruina in my spare time. Since I am more interested in programming, 
                    I can increase my advantage by obtaining information-related certificates.

                    and obtained the course as quickly as possible. Team competition first prize.

                    build a donation fan page and chatbot, and design and produce the rewards. These learning processes have allowed me to develop a good understanding of cooperation with the group members,
                    and also enhanced our interaction with each other, allowing me to better understand how to cooperate with others in the group.

                    Special fourth and fifth period, this stage is a year when group special topics are born.
                    In order to come up with a challenging and attractive topic,
                    our team came up with the topic title "Code block and Computational Thinking".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This educational game will be developed at first, just as Taiwan's education system is facing a new syllabus for 108 years. Therefore, 
                    our group members see that the program education in elementary school lacks some suitable teaching tools.
                    Therefore, this educational game is proposed to solve the teaching problem of information teachers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the development of the "CodeBlock Building Block Program and Computational Thinking" project, I was mainly responsible for the theme conception, planning book, and system manual writing. In the technical part,
                    Html, Unity and WebGL are used to develop building block games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I mainly focus on the game mechanism design, and then assist other team members to complete the logic design, rule design and so on. In this competition,
                    I felt the importance of teamwork, and I also learned how to tolerate and communicate with students from different family backgrounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During these two years, my team members and I worked day and night to catch up with the progress, test and complete the first edition; finally,
                    we won the second prize of the special competition.
